A Java Student Contact System.

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield.

A simple system to store details of students, to be used as a case study in first year teaching.

The modelling has been completed in Visual Paradigm using the VP plug-in to IntelliJ.  You will need a similar set
up (and a licence key) to open the models.  The code can be opened in any suitable IDE (I recommend IntelliJ).
